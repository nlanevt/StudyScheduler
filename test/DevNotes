DevNotes:
Program Purpose
Given a time frame (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.):
1.) Generate a set of data structures and algorithms to develop
2.) Generate book problems to solve

TODO
1.) Add exceptions that shutdown program rather than just output to the command line
2.) Make it so if there are no new CS chapters (for example), that this doesn't show in the output
3.) Make multiple chapters occur on one line in the output, not on multiple, 
	e.g.: Study Linear Algebra, Chapter 1, 2 and 3 (NEW). Tag it with (NEW) if the chapter is new.
4.) Finish Github repository setup to allow commiting locally
